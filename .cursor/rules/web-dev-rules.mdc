- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Use css for styling.
- Use responsive design with a mobile-first approach.
- Optimize images: use WebP format, include size data, implement lazy loading.
- Implement accessibility features on elements. For example, a tag should have a tabindex=“0”, aria-label, on:click, and on:keydown, and similar attributes.
- Use consts instead of functions, for example, “const toggle = () =>”. Also, define a type if possible.
